    <string name="start">GOT IT</string>
    <string name="slider1text">It\'s basically an app for advertising information, products and all
    types of services to users from across the country. </string>
    <string name="slider1title">Tap, View And Go</string>
    <string name="slider2title">AdCafé</string>
    <string name="slider2text">Basically you\'ll be able to view ads uploaded by advertisers in the app
    and also advertise your product to the app\'s users.</string>
    <string name="slider2hello">Hello!</string>
    <string name="slider2take">Take a Tour</string>


    <string name="slide3text2">We want to make advertising cool; We believe that the adCafe can do just that, and do it in a way that is
        effective, interesting and maybe, just maybe, entertaining.</string>

    <string name="slide4text">Even better! Among many other benefits, the AdCafe gives you the ability to
        reach many of its users in a very short period of time.</string>

    <string name="slide5text">Not quite yet! First you\'ll need to know how to use the app and for that we\'ve prepared
        a short tutorial on how you will interact with it.</string>

    <string name="slide6text">Now the main page will look something like this.
        Don\'t worry, we will go over what everything is and what everything does.</string>

    <string name="slide7text">The advert banners will be hosted in cards looking like this. The centre to top part is where the banner will
        be.</string>

    <string name="slide8text">Below the banner are some buttons which enable you to perform some actions on the ad.</string>

    <string name="slide9text">At the top of the page are two items, a timer (to the left) and an AdCounter (to the right).</string>
    <string name="timerExplanation">The timer counts down 7 seconds. During this period you cannot move to the next ad, but only
        after the timer hits 0. Remember that.</string>
    <string name="adcounterExplanation">The AdCounter simply shows you the number of adverts you\'ve seen in the day.</string>


    <string name="slide10text">Below the AdCards are buttons which can help you do more cool stuff.</string>
    <string name="logoutbuttonexplanation">Logout Button : You can logout of your account using this button.</string>
    <string name="pinlisticon">Ad Archive Button : This window is where you can view all your pinned ads.</string>
    <string name="dashboardexplanation">Dashboard Button : This window is where all the stats concerning the number of ads you\'ve
        see are stored.</string>
    <string name="shareappexplanation">Share App Button : This will help you share the app with your friends and mates. Feel free to
        share ;)</string>


    <string name="slide11text">Share and talk about the app with your friends; lets turn this into something big!</string>

    <string name="slide12text">No it is optional, meaning you do not have to engage in it if you don\'t want to.</string>

    <string name="slide13text">Its quite simple really. Essentially you will be monetised based on (and in proportion to) the
        number of ads you see.</string>
